## Projects

### ❖ Contrify: Application for Personalized Recommendations for Open-Source Contribution.
**May 2024**  
Developed a machine learning-based system with a MERN stack interface to recommend GitHub repositories for open-source contributions.  
**Technologies**: Python, TF-IDF, LDA, BERT, Cosine Similarity, GitHub API, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js  
- Automated metadata retrieval with Python scripts.
- Applied NLP techniques, including TF-IDF, LDA, and BERT, for text preprocessing and keyword extraction.
- Enhanced recommendation accuracy using Cosine Similarity, clustering, and BERT-based embeddings.  
**Outcome**: Provided personalized repository suggestions, improved user experience, and encouraged open-source contributions.

### ❖ Dog Vision: Dog Breed Detection App Using Machine Learning and Flutter
**Dec 2023**  
Developed a Flutter application integrated with a machine learning model to detect 120 unique dog breeds from images.  
**Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Flutter, Firebase  
- Trained a CNN with transfer learning using TensorFlow Hub, classifying 120 dog breeds from 10,000+ images.
- Created a real-time breed detection app in Flutter with TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device predictions.
- Integrated Firebase for data management and authentication, allowing seamless image uploads and breed predictions.  
**Outcome**: Created an interactive mobile app that accurately identifies dog breeds, enhancing user engagement with a responsive UI.

### ❖ Flood Prediction Using Neural Networks and Geospatial Data 
**Dec 2023**  
Created a model to predict flood-affected areas using neural networks and geospatial data.  
**Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, NetCDF4, Cartopy, Folium  
- Utilized historical geospatial data (aspect, elevation, slope, TWI, etc.) to identify vulnerable areas.
- Applied machine learning algorithms for analyzing susceptibility, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- Developed interactive visualizations with Cartopy and Folium, highlighting flood-prone regions.  
**Outcome**: Enhanced accuracy in flood prediction and provided actionable insights through visualizations.
